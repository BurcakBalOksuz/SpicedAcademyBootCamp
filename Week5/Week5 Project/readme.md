Project_Week5

In this project, I built a dashboard using open source service Metabase summarizing the Northwind Database. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.

For this project data was uploaded into PostgreSQL Database in Amazon RDS instance. Then Metabase was installed on an AWS EC2 Machine and used for creating a publically available Metabase dashboard.
